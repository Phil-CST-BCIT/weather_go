# WeatherCLI in Golang

**Project Goals**  
The project's primary goal was to practice how to use Goroutine and some built-in packages to consume a RESTful api from a third party.

Reading some weather information from an API is an easy task, it can be done by many other languages. But, since we use Golang, it provides us an option to consume an API simutaneously using multiple threads, which are Goroutines.

Another feather about this app is that it sorts the final results in an lexical order.
